<h2>Implications for research and policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>PFS measure can definitely be optimized by incorporating financial information about the property owners themselves</li>
<li>Analysis can be repeated for any city to locate well-kept areas within it and identify who is investinging them</li>
<li>These trends can be then studied by city officials to make better decisions on how to attract investors to a city</li>
